# vsig_flutter

Hello Welcome to the project 

Coded this in less than 8 hours from scratch using OpenAi Image generation Dall-e-2, not using 3 because of constraints

## Getting Started

To use download the package, then create .env file with the text openaiApiKey=############# with ########## being your API key

e.g 
```
openaiApiKey=#########
```

Then flutter get, then flutter run android.

Make sure you have some openai token there kudos!,
P.S if you have a good openAI account with some money in there you can go to generateimageprovider.dart and change the model from there.
